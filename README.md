# Synopsis

Fit-Inn is a web-based service that allows users to both post listings and make reservations for home gyms.

Fit-Inn is a web-based home gym rental service, designed to allow owners of home gym equipment to rent their space and equipment for financial compensation as well as allowing other users to reserve a time slot at owner's home gyms. Additionally, the service serves as an open-source proof-of-concept demonstrating the capabilities and technology of Vendia. 

The service will facilitate payment, scheduling, and keep track of every user's information via user profiles. Users will log into their profiles using Single Sign-On.

# Deployment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Running this project requires [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### `npm install`

This will install all necessary dependencies which are listed in the package.json file.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
